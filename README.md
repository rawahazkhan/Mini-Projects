# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects. The purpose of this repository is to keep practice projects organized in one place and to document progress as I continue learning and experimenting with Python. Each project is stored in its own folder and contains a `main.py` file along with a workspace.

## Purpose

* Build a strong foundation in Python through hands-on coding.
* Explore different problem-solving approaches.
* Maintain an organized record of practice projects in one place.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into a project folder:

   ```bash
   cd project-folder-name
   ```
3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Each project folder is independent and can be run on its own.

### Word Guessing Game

A terminal-based word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly chosen word one letter at a time.

* A word is randomly selected from a predefined word bank.
* The player has 10 attempts to guess the word correctly.
* Correct guesses reveal the letterâ€™s position(s) in the word.
* Incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
* The game ends when the player either guesses the full word or runs out of attempts.

**Usage:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**Example Gameplay:**

```
Current word: _ _ _ _ _ _

Guess the letter: o
Oop! Wrong Guess, Attempts left: 9

Current word: _ _ _ _ _ _

Guess the letter: y
Wow! You guessed right!

Current word: _ y _ _ _ _
```
